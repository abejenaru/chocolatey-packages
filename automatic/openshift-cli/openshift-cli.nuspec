    <summary>OpenShift Origin is a distribution of Kubernetes optimized for continuous application development and multi-tenant deployment. OpenShift Origin is the open source upstream project that powers OpenShift, Red Hat's container application platform.</summary>
    <description>OpenShift adds developer and operations-centric tools on top of Kubernetes to enable rapid application development, easy deployment and scaling, and long-term lifecycle maintenance for small and large teams.

Features:
* Easily build applications with integrated service discovery and persistent storage.
* Quickly and easily scale applications to handle periods of increased demand.
    * Support for automatic high availability, load balancing, health checking, and failover.
* Push source code to your Git repository and automatically deploy containerized applications.
* Web console and command-line client for building and monitoring applications.
* Centralized administration and management of an entire stack, team, or organization.
    * Create reusable templates for components of your system, and iteratively deploy them over time.
    * Roll out modifications to software stacks to your entire organization in a controlled fashion.
    * Integration with your existing authentication mechanisms, including LDAP, Active Directory, and public OAuth providers such as GitHub.
* Multi-tenancy support, including team and user isolation of containers, builds, and network communication.
    * Allow developers to run containers securely with fine-grained controls in production.
    * Limit, track, and manage the developers and teams on the platform.
